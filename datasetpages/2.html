The dataset contains information on customer initiated service requests entered into the City of Windsor 311 system from various channels (phone, email, online self-serve, text). 311 manages the service request data for City of Windsor departments and divisions represented in this dataset. As such, 311 consulted the participating divisions and subject matter experts for this release. This data set is extracted electronically from the 311 customer request management system.</p>

This data represents requests for service entered into the 311 system initiated from the customer's perspective based on description provided by the customer at the time of contact with 311. However, during the request fulfillment process, it could be determined that the customer's request may not be valid or may need to be adjusted. For example a request for a tree trim is made, but upon investigation by the Forestry department it is determined that the tree is on private property and therefore the responsibility of the property owner to maintain. Review of data should take into consideration the urban attributes and context of the issue being reported, such as vegetation density, population density, age of infrastructure asset, zoning and applicable by-laws, and it should also be noted that multiple reports may be received for the same issue, which can influence results.</p>
